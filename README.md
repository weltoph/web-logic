# Logic applets
This repository contains a collection of small educational applets. Every
applet is a single-page application. The scope of the individual applets is
supposed to be limited; fully embracing the KISS principle. A list of the
applets follows.

## Truthtables
This applet allows to input a propositional formula and constructs the
corresponding truthtable.

## Syntaxtree
Given a propositional formula this applet displays the corresponding
syntaxtree.

## FO-graph
Via a simple interface a simple graph with three color classes can be
constructed. The resulting graph structure can be used to evaluate FO-formulae.
